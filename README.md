  CodeLeap Network
</h3>

This challenge consisted of replicating the [CodeLeap Network](https://www.figma.com/design/0OQWLQmU14SF2cDhHPJ2sx/CodeLeap-Engineering-Test) prototype to build a simple social network with full CRUD functionality, using CodeLeap's public API endpoints.

The project was made using <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, React Router for routing between pages, Redux Toolkit for state persistence, React Hook Form combined with Yup for form management and validation, and Axios for HTTP requests.
